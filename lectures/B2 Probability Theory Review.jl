  * Review of Probability Theory as a theory for rational/logical reasoning with uncertainties (i.e., a Bayesian interpretation)

Materials        

  * Mandatory

      * These lecture notes

## [Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Bayesian-Devinderjit-Sivia/dp/0198568320)

The following is an excerpt from the book [Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Bayesian-Devinderjit-Sivia/dp/0198568320) (2006), by D.S. Sivia with J.S. Skilling:

In this lesson we introduce *Probability Theory* (PT) again. As we will see in the next lessons, PT is all you need to make sense of machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, etc.

**Problem**: Given a disease with prevalence of  1%  and a test procedure  with sensitivity ('true positive' rate) of  95%  and specificity ('true negative' rate) of  85% , what is the chance that somebody who tests positive actually has the disease?

In developing this calculus, only some very agreeable assumptions were made, including:

  * (Representation). Degrees of rational belief (or, as we shall later call them, probabilities) about the truth value of propositions are represented by real numbers.
  * (Transitivity). If the belief in ``A`` is greater than the belief in ``B``, and the belief in ``B`` is greater than the belief in ``C``, then the belief in ``A`` must be greater than the belief in ``C``.
  * (Consistency). If the belief in an event can be inferred in two different ways, then the two ways must agree on the resulting belief.

In the **Bayesian** interpretation, the probability is associated with a **state-of-knowledge** (usually held by a person, but formally by a rational agent). 

  * For instance, in a coin tossing experiment, ``p(\texttt{tail}) = 0.4`` should be interpreted as the belief that there is a 40% chance that ``\texttt{tail}`` comes up if the coin were tossed.
  * Under the Bayesian interpretation, PT calculus (sum and product rules) **extends boolean logic to rational reasoning with uncertainty**.

The Bayesian interpretation contrasts with the **frequentist** interpretation of a probability as the relative frequency that an event would occur under repeated execution of an experiment.

Using standard statistical methods is like driving a car at night on a poorly lit highway: to keep from going in a ditch, we could build an elaborate system of bumpers and guardrails and equip the car with lane departure warnings and sophisticated navigation systems, and even then we could at best only drive to a few destinations.

## Events

Technically, a probability expresses a degree-of-belief in the truth value of an event. Let's first define an event.

A = \text{`it will rain tomorrow'}

## Independent, Exclusive and Exhaustive Events

It will be helpful to introduce some terms concerning special relationships between events.  

Two events ``A`` and ``B`` are said to be **independent** if the probability of one event is not altered by information about the truth of the other event, i.e., 

```math
p(A|B) = p(A)\,.
```

```math
\Rightarrow
```

If ``A`` and ``B`` are independent, then the product rule simplifies to 

```math
p(A,B) = p(A) p(B)\,.
```

```math
A
```

and ``B`` with given background ``I`` are said to be **conditionally independent** if ``p(A|B,I) = p(A|I)``. In that case, the product rule simplifies to ``p(A,B|I) = p(A|I) p(B|I)``.

Two events ``A_1`` and ``A_2`` are said to be **mutually exclusive** ('disjoint') if they cannot be true simultanously, i.e., if ``p(A_1,A_2)=0``.

```math
\Rightarrow
```

For mutually exclusive events, probability adds (this follows from the sum rule): 

```math
p(A_1+A_2) = p(A_1) + p(A_2)
```

A set of events ``A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N`` is said to be **collectively exhaustive** if one of the statements is necessarily true, i.e., ``A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_N=\mathrm{TRUE}``, or equivalently 

```math
p(A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_N)=1
```

If a set of events ``A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n`` are both **mutually exclusive** and **collectively exhausitive** events, then we say that they **partition the universe**. Technically, this means that 

```math
\sum_{n=1}^N p(A_n) = p(A_1 + \ldots + A_N) = 1
```

```

This rule is called the [law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability). Proof:

```math
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i p(A,B_i) &= p(\sum_i AB_i)  &&\quad \text{(since all $AB_i$ are disjoint)}\\
  &= p(A,\sum_i B_i) \\

## A Notational Convention

Finally, here is a notational convention that you should be precise about (but many authors are not).

If you want to write that a variable ``x`` is distributed as a Gaussian with mean ``\mu`` and covariance matrix ``\Sigma``, you can write this properly in either of two ways:

```math
\begin{align*} 
p(x) &= \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\Sigma) \\
x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)
\end{align*}
```

In the second version, the symbol ``\sim`` can be interpreted as "is distributed as" (a Gaussian with parameters ``\mu`` and ``\Sigma``).

Don't write ``p(x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)`` because ``p(x)`` is a function of ``x`` but ``\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)`` is not. 

Also, ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\Sigma)`` is not proper because you already named the argument at the right-hand-site. On the other hand, ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(\cdot|\mu,\Sigma)`` is fine, as is the shorter ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)``.
